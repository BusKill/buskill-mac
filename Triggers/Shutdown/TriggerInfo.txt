Trigger is part of the BusKill Project and complies with the term of its license agreement 
 
The Shutdown Trigger will forcably turn off your system. If FileVault or any other Third Party Startup encryption is in place this will activate as normal.
It is reccomended you check with your system administrator before using this Trigger as it has only been tested on personal systems. 
The Developer will not take responsibility for any damaged caused. and if concerned you should instead consider using the "Lock" Trigger instead. 

Enjoy BusKill =)
